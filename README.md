Dharma

Dharma is an in-development platform for the sneakerhead community ‚Äî built to go beyond bots.
It‚Äôs designed as the backbone of a next-generation sneakerhead network: combining the speed of automated checkout with the culture of cook groups, hyperlocal feeds, and tokenized participation.

The project combines robust tooling (checkout orchestration, anti-bot hygiene, adapters for multiple sites) with a roadmap for community governance and tokenized incentives, enabling users to participate in and benefit from the ecosystem they help power.

‚∏ª

## üöÄ Project Overview

* **Core Purpose**: Automate checkout and carting flows with extensibility across retailers, while providing a community-driven, privacy-conscious backbone.
* **Vision**: Move beyond isolated automation scripts toward a production-ready framework that supports decentralized community participation, token incentives, and a plug-and-play adapter architecture.
* **Key Concepts**:
  * Checkout orchestration with retries, logging, and error handling
  * Multi-SKU carting and simulation harnesses
  * Adapter registry for new site integrations
  * Tokenized community environment for contribution and governance

‚∏ª

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

Dharma is structured around modular services and tools:

* `services/`: Contains core checkout orchestration, adapters, and APIs.
  * `checkout/` ‚Äì orchestrates carting, retries, error handling
  * `adapters/` ‚Äì site-specific integrations for automated checkout
  * `community/` ‚Äì backend for decentralized/tokenized participation (in-progress scaffolding)
* `tools/`: Utilities for CLI operations, testing harnesses, and adapter debugging.
* `tests/`: Unit and integration test suites (with TODOs for adapter simulation tests).
* `workflows/`: CI/CD, health checks, and resilience scaffolds for automated deployment.

‚∏ª

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python (services, tools, adapters), JavaScript/TypeScript (front-end + future dashboard)
* **Frameworks / Libraries**:
  * FastAPI / Flask (backend services)
  * Playwright / Puppeteer (browser automation, checkout simulation)
  * Pytest (testing suite)
* **Infrastructure**: Dockerized services, GitHub Actions workflows

‚∏ª

## üìã Requirements

* Python 3.11+
* Node.js 20+ (for future front-end scaffolds & tooling)
* Docker (recommended for containerized runs)
* Git

To get started:

1. Click the "Code" button on the repository's page and select "Open with Codespaces".
2. Once the Codespace is created, it will automatically install all dependencies.
3. When the setup is complete, run the services with one command:

```bash
make up
```

## Frontend Quickstart

To run the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## UI Features

The current UI is built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It includes the following features:

*   **Hyperlocal Feed**: A feed of sneaker drops and other community activity.
*   **Quest Board**: A list of tasks that users can complete to earn rewards.
*   **Drops Hub**: A calendar of upcoming sneaker drops and a "War Room" for real-time chat and status updates.
*   **Map**: A map view of stores and events. **Note**: This is currently a placeholder. A map library like `react-leaflet` needs to be installed and configured.
*   **Wallet**: A slide-in drawer that displays the user's coin balance, boosts, and bounties.

## üß© Development Guide

### Adding a New Adapter

1. Create a new file under `services/checkout/adapters/`.
2. Implement required methods (`add_to_cart`, `checkout`, `handle_captcha`, etc.).
3. Register the adapter in the adapter registry (`services/checkout/registry.py`).
4. Write simulation + test cases in `tests/adapters/`.

### Resilience Features

* Built-in retries with exponential backoff
* Configurable timeouts
* Logging hooks for CI/CD monitoring

### Anti-Bot Hygiene

* Human-like browser flows (Playwright scaffolding)
* Proxy rotation and rate limiting
* TODO: Machine-learning-based request pattern randomization

## üåê Community & Tokenization Roadmap

The Dharma roadmap includes evolving into a tokenized community environment:

* **Contribution Rewards**: Developers earn tokens for new adapters, bug fixes, and infrastructure improvements.
* **Governance**: Token-holders influence feature priorities and community rules.
* **Marketplace**: Potential for decentralized exchange of adapters, tools, or community services.

Current Status: Backend scaffolds (`services/community/`) are live; tokenized logic remains TODO with smart contract stubs to be introduced.
