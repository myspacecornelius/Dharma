# SNPD

SNPD started as a sneaker checkout bot ‚Äî but it‚Äôs always been about more than automation.  
It‚Äôs the backbone of a **next-generation sneakerhead community**: combining the speed of automated checkout with the culture of cook groups, hyperlocal feeds, and tokenized participation.

## üöÄ Vision

- **For Sneakerheads, By Sneakerheads**: A platform where members connect, share, and strategize around drops.  
- **Cook Group DNA**: Built on the culture of alerts, monitors, and shared knowledge.  
- **Beyond Bots**: It‚Äôs not just about copping pairs ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **community, collaboration, and reputation**.  
- **Token Incentives**: Earn tokens by contributing (intel, results, testing), spend them on access, perks, or influence.  
- **Social DNA**: Feeds feel familiar (inspired by Instagram + Yik Yak) but built for sneaker culture and hyperlocal engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è What SNPD Does

- **Checkout Automation**: Core tooling to secure hyped sneakers at release.  
- **Community Feeds**: Location-aware posts and updates around drops.  
- **Token Mechanics**: Contribution ‚Üí rewards ‚Üí access + status.  
- **Hyperlocal Features**: Surface and reward participation at the city/street level.  
- **Adapters**: Modular integrations for retailers and raffle systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Overview

- **Languages**: Python (automation, services), TypeScript/JavaScript (front-end/dashboard).  
- **Frameworks**:  
  - FastAPI (services & APIs)  
  - Playwright (automation & simulation)  
  - React/Next.js (planned social layer)  
- **Infra**:  
  - Dockerized services  
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
  - Token logic (smart contract stubs in repo)

## üß† Architecture Details

### Core Sneaker Access Functionality

- **Automation Engine:**  
  - **Task Queue:** Use a robust task queue like RabbitMQ or Redis to manage purchase requests. Each request will be a job in the queue.  
  - **Worker Pool:** A pool of worker processes (or servers) will consume jobs from the queue. Each worker will be responsible for running a Playwright script to automate the purchase process. This architecture allows for horizontal scaling to handle a large number of requests simultaneously.  
  - **Playwright Scripts:** Develop modular and retailer-specific Playwright scripts. Each script will handle the entire purchase flow for a specific website, from adding to cart to checking out.  
- **Data Management:**  
  - **User Data:** Securely store user's personal and payment data in an encrypted format in a database.  
  - **Session Management:** Use a distributed session management system like Redis to maintain user sessions across multiple servers.  

### Community & Monitoring Layer

- **Real-time Alerts:**  
  - **Monitoring Service:** A dedicated service will continuously monitor sneaker websites for restocks. This can be done by periodically scraping the websites or by using APIs if available.  
  - **WebSocket Server:** When a restock is detected, the monitoring service will publish an event to a WebSocket server (e.g., using Socket.IO).  
  - **Client-side Connection:** The frontend application will maintain a persistent WebSocket connection to the server to receive real-time alerts.  
- **Geohashing:**  
  - **Database:** Use a database with spatial indexing capabilities like PostgreSQL with PostGIS.  
  - **Geocoding API:** Use a geocoding API like the Google Maps Geocoding API or a self-hosted solution like Nominatim to convert addresses to latitude and longitude.  
  - **Spatial Queries:** Use the database's spatial query capabilities to find nearby sneaker activity and events.  
- **Tokenized "Karma" System:**  
  - **Karma Ledger:** A simple database table will act as a ledger, tracking all karma transactions.  
  - **Karma Rules Engine:** A module will define the rules for earning and spending karma. For example, reporting a restock might earn a user 10 karma points, while entering a raffle might cost 5 karma points.

üß© Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	Social layer: posts, replies, likes, location-aware feeds.
	‚Ä¢	Token economy: reward contributors, unlock perks, govern features.
	‚Ä¢	Expanded adapters: cover more retailers + raffles.
	‚Ä¢	Hyperlocal cook group experiences.
	‚Ä¢	Seamless blend of automation + community.
