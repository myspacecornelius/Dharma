### **1. Architecture**

#### **Core Sneaker Access Functionality**

*   **Automation Engine:**
    *   **Task Queue:** Use a robust task queue like RabbitMQ or Redis to manage purchase requests. Each request will be a job in the queue.
    *   **Worker Pool:** A pool of worker processes (or servers) will consume jobs from the queue. Each worker will be responsible for running a Playwright script to automate the purchase process. This architecture allows for horizontal scaling to handle a large number of requests simultaneously.
    *   **Playwright Scripts:** Develop modular and retailer-specific Playwright scripts. Each script will handle the entire purchase flow for a specific website, from adding to cart to checking out.
*   **Data Management:**
    *   **User Data:** Securely store user's personal and payment data in an encrypted format in a database.
    *   **Session Management:** Use a distributed session management system like Redis to maintain user sessions across multiple servers.

#### **Community & Monitoring Layer**

*   **Real-time Alerts:**
    *   **Monitoring Service:** A dedicated service will continuously monitor sneaker websites for restocks. This can be done by periodically scraping the websites or by using APIs if available.
    *   **WebSocket Server:** When a restock is detected, the monitoring service will publish an event to a WebSocket server (e.g., using Socket.IO).
    *   **Client-side Connection:** The frontend application will maintain a persistent WebSocket connection to the server to receive real-time alerts.
*   **Geohashing:**
    *   **Database:** Use a database with spatial indexing capabilities like PostgreSQL with PostGIS.
    *   **Geocoding API:** Use a geocoding API like the Google Maps Geocoding API or a self-hosted solution like Nominatim to convert addresses to latitude and longitude.
    *   **Spatial Queries:** Use the database's spatial query capabilities to find nearby sneaker activity and events.
*   **Tokenized "Karma" System:**
    *   **Karma Ledger:** A simple database table will act as a ledger, tracking all karma transactions.
    *   **Karma Rules Engine:** A module will define the rules for earning and spending karma. For example, reporting a restock might earn a user 10 karma points, while entering a raffle might cost 5 karma points.

### **4. UX Flows**

#### **Core Sneaker Bot Features**

1.  **Onboarding:** User creates an account, and securely enters their shipping and payment information.
2.  **Task Creation:** User browses for an upcoming sneaker release and creates a "task" by specifying the sneaker, size, and the store to purchase from.
3.  **Automation:** On release day, the user's task is picked up by a worker, which runs the Playwright script to attempt the purchase.
4.  **Notification:** The user is notified in real-time about the status of their purchase attempt (e.g., "In Queue," "Processing Payment," "Success," "Failed").

#### **Community Engagement Features**

1.  **Feed:** The main screen of the community section is a real-time feed of restocks, new sneaker announcements, and other user activity.
2.  **Restock Reporting:** A user can report a restock they've found. After verification, they are awarded karma points.
3.  **Trading:** A user can browse sneakers owned by other users and initiate a trade. The other user is notified and can accept or reject the trade.
4.  **Local Events:** A map view shows sneaker-related events and meetups happening near the user's location.

### **5. Security and Anti-Bot Detection Countermeasures**

*   **Secure Data Storage:**
    *   Encrypt all sensitive user data, both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
    *   Use a secure vault like HashiCorp Vault for managing encryption keys.
*   **Anti-Bot Evasion:**
    *   **Proxy Management:** Integrate with a residential proxy service to rotate IP addresses for each purchase attempt.
    *   **CAPTCHA Solving:** Use a CAPTCHA solving service like 2Captcha or Anti-Captcha to solve CAPTCHAs encountered during the checkout process.
    *   **Browser Fingerprinting:** Use a tool like `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` (for Puppeteer, with similar solutions available for Playwright) to randomize browser fingerprints and make the automation scripts appear more human-like.
    *   **Human-like Automation:** Introduce random delays and mouse movements into the Playwright scripts to mimic human behavior.
